I'm Abongwa Bonalais, I studied Computer Engineering at the National Higher Polytechnic Institute at the University of Bamenda, I like coding, gaming, and listening to Rap.

I did apply to Outreachy this year ( my 4th attempt ) as I’ve been rejected 3 times. I didn’t give up, I became more tenacious than ever before, And in this year's Outreachy May 2023 to August 2023 internship round, I got selected… Hurrayyyyy!!

I’m Interning with OCaml on the project Improve error reporting in existing ppxlib-based PPXs my mentor for the project is Paul-Elliot.

## My Core Values

I have many values that govern my life but I’ll pick up 3.

### Determination

I value Determination because, in recent years, I have realized that the first step to doing something successfully no matter how hard it is, is by first being determined and convicted that you can do it, with this will come a way. This concept has ruled most of my life consciously or unconsciously.

### Self-respect

I value self-respect because I believe that charity begins at home, If you do not respect yourself, people tend to look down on you almost automatically, so I think it is important to have self-respect, this also means respecting others' beliefs, boundaries, and ideologies.

### Curiosity

I am always ready to learn new things and like to know how something works, this value dropped recently because I got shy recently ( I really do not know why), but I am curious nevertheless.

## My Motivation for Outreachy

The primary motivation for joining Outeachy is that I saw the opportunity to learn, grow and acquire the resources and knowledge I needed for my development career as a whole, for instance, my friend who is a past Outrachy intern, has been growing in the tech space since getting the internship, and I got inspired by her to give Outreachy a try, and I do not regret that decision.

#### What is Outreachy?

Outreachy provides internships in open-source and open science. Outreachy offers internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technology industry where they are living.

#### Why did I choose Outreachy?

It’s Open source
It’s diverse
It’s paid
It’s remote
It has one of my values ( Freedom )
I believe Outreachy is the platform that is going to skyrocket my career to the next level!
